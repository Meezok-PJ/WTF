## üë®‚Äçüíª Automated Lightweight Kali Sandbox inside WTF
---
* Let‚Äôs get straight to it. This tool is your personal, Script testing Kali sandbox, now Integrated directly into the **WTF (Wrapper Tactical Framework)**. It's a lightweight, isolated environment that lets you test whatever you want malicious scripts, custom tools, or anything from GitHub  without trashing your host system or messing up your VM's dependencies.

* Forget clunky `docker` commands and manual installs. This sandbox is **menu-driven** and **user-friendly**, meaning once you exit the container shell, you're dropped right back into the menu. This makes management a breeze, letting you focus on the fun stuff.

### Key Features

* **Rapid Deployment:** Go from zero to a fully functional Kali environment in seconds with Docker Compose.
* **Host System Protection:** The container is truly isolated, so a buggy script or a malicious tool will not affect your host operating system.
* **Persistent Storage:** A dedicated volume ensures all your work, scripts, and data are saved and available even after the container is shut down and restarted.
* **Pre-installed Toolset:** The Dockerfile includes essential tools like `nmap`, `curl`, and `git`, saving you from repetitive manual installations.
* **Portability:** The `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` ensure the exact same environment can be recreated on any machine with Docker installed.

### Project Philosophy

For a deeper dive into the original project's architecture and design philosophy, check out the **[Automated Kali Docker Project](test)**. This is the foundation upon which the new, upgraded WTF tool was built.

>I built this tool out of sheer necessity. I was testing an OSINT framework one day, and it started installing a ridiculous number of dependencies and extra tools. I watched it create strange shortcuts and files all over my virtual machine. That's when it hit me: why not create a safe environment to run these tools? A place where they could install whatever they wanted without affecting my system's package dependencies or leaving digital clutter behind. This project is the result of that frustration ‚Äî a clean, contained space where you can test to your heart's content, no cleanup required.

Now let‚Äôs create a scenario use case: testing **my own framework project**. First we build the Docker image, then access it, then `git clone` our repo, and finally run the tool üëç (treating my script as a malicious GitHub script üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è).

---

### Use Case: Testing a GitHub Project üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

This sandbox is the perfect place to safely test and evaluate tools you find online, especially those with a lot of dependencies. Let's walk through an example. We will test my own framework (**WTF**) as an example.

1. **Start the Sandbox:** From the main WTF menu we select option \[3] to access the Kali Sandbox menu options, then choose `[1] Build & start Kali (compose)`.

* **As you can see the project/tool will be saved in the home directory path for easy access later**

* **After starting Docker, the project is built in the specified directory with persistent storage, Dockerfile/yaml, and README**

* `[Output]` The Docker image is built and the container is started. The script confirms the persistent volume is created and ready.

3. **Access the Shell:** From the Kali menu, we select `[3] Access shell`.

* `[Output]` The terminal drops us into the isolated Kali environment. We are now inside the sandbox, ready to get to work. Type `exit` to return to the Kali menu.

 ![23-27-54-WTF-24-08-2025.png](WTF-assets/23-27-54-WTF-24-08-2025.png)  

- Clone my tool to test a real-world scenario (like testing a random script you found on GitHub).

As you can see in the screenshot, you can debug a tool and watch how it behaves. In this example, a missing package (`bc`) .

5. **We navigate to the `/mnt` directory (our persistent volume)** this is connected to `~/sandbox` on the host. Use `/mnt` if you want to move files/folders from container ‚Üí host machine.

- create a file then copy it to the Presistant Volume`/mnt`
![20-29-33-WTF-25-08-2025.png](WTF-assets/20-29-33-WTF-25-08-2025.png)
- exit from container by typing `exit`  then press `Enter`.
***
- lets check what files my Automated Creates
**`cd ~/sandox`**: this is the Mounted Volume where u can see Files u Copied.
**`cd ~/kali_sandbox`**: main folder contains Dockerfile + docker-compose u can edit the container setting how ever u want.Also u can execute `manage.sh` that Enters manual mode of Accessing Container(old version of my Project)

* The manual Mode:
* *Tip: use an alias to easily access container.*
```bash
 [~/kali_sandbox]
 meezok ÓÇ∞ sudo ./manage.sh                   
[sudo] password for meezok:
